The contents of a freshly allocated array are unknown.

p contains the address of the element with index 2.
Writing to p has the same effect as writing to ns[2].

p[0] means "take the first element of the array starting at address p".
Even though we never actually created an array at that address,
we can pretend we did. Since p points to ns[1],
the array pointed at by p starts there too, meaning p[0] and ns[1] are the same.

p can be seen as an array overlapping with ns:
it's shifted three items to the right with respect to ns.
p[0] coincides with ns[2], and similarly, p[1] with ns[3].

There's nothing wrong with negative indices as long as you end up inside the array.

You're not allowed to go beyond the array's bounds.
